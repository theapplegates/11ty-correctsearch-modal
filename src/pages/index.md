It usually starts as, "Hi Dad what's wrong now?". Thankfully I am on my laptop so I don't have to run to my office Mac.
Dad has started to show early signs of dementia. My [project](https://testing.whatswrongnowdad.com/en/introduction) will let him help himself when he does not understand the world around him. Thankfully he has the same Apple products I have, which makes it easy to fix his problems, unless I can't connect remotely which is no fun for me. Stay tuned as I add to his story and since it is opensourced I look forward to helping others as well.
